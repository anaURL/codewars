# codewars

These are my solutions to [codewars code katas](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard/), and my codewars profile can be found [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/ana_URL/). Language is Javascript.

As stated above, this repo includes my own solutions and posting them daily helps me keep the pace, code on a daily basis, and improve as a developer. But if you're a Codewarrior - before looking at my solutions, please take the time to think about your own approach. :) 

Here is my Codewarrior Profile Badge with current status:
